        <h1>What is Fashion?</h1>
            <dl>
                <dt>Fashion:</dt>
                <dd>A popular trend, especially in styles of dress and ornament or manners of behavior.</dd>
                <dt>Style:</dt>
                <dd>A distinctive appearance, typically determined by the principles according to which something is designed.</dd>
            </dl>
            
            <p>Fashion is something we deal with everyday. Even people who say they don't care what they wear choose clothes every morning that say a lot about them and how they feel that day.</p>
            
            <p>One certain thing in the fashion world is <strong>change</strong>. We are constantly being bombarded with new fashion ideas from music, videos, books, and television. Movies also have a big impact on what people wear. Ray-Ban sold more sunglasses after the movie Men In Black. Sometimes a trend is <em>world-wide.</em> <a href="1970s.html#1970s">Back in the 1970s</a>, people everywhere dressed in bell bottom pants.</p>
    
       
        <h2>Who Influences Fashion Trends?</h2>   
            <ul>
                <li>Musicians and other cultural icons</li>
                <li>Political figures and royalty</li>
                <li>Newspapers and magazines</li>
                
            </ul>
           
            <p>Even folks in the 1700s pored over fashion magazines to see the latest styles. Women and dressmakers outside the French court relied on sketches to see what was going on. The famous French King Louis XIV said that fashion is a mirror. Louis himself was renowned for his style, which tended towards extravagant laces and velvets.</p>
